# AC Signal

Nature of the signal ? 
What AC signal means?

1. Definition â€“ An AC (Alternating Current) signal is an electrical waveform in which the current changes direction periodically. In power systems, this is typically a sinusoidal waveform with a frequency of 50 Hz (in India) or 60 Hz (in some other countries).


2. Nature of AC Signal

Alternates between positive and negative values periodically.

Frequency: 50 Hz (changes polarity 50 times per second).

Amplitude: Depends on the power line voltage level (e.g., 230V for single-phase, 11kV for distribution lines).



3. Role in the Project

The AC signal from the power line is the primary input to the system.

This signal carries critical information about the health of the grid (normal condition or fault).

Before processing, the AC signal is stepped down and conditioned for measurement and fault analysis.
