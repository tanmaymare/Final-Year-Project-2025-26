# ADC 

ADC meaning Analog-to-Digital Converters, they are most essential component for linking the digital world to analong world.Since many real-world phenomena, including sound, light, temperature, and pressure, are essentially analog, ADCs are essential for transforming these analog signals into digital ones so that digital systems may process, analyze, store, or communicate with them. 

An electrical component known as an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) transforms an analog input signal, often a voltage or current, into a digital representation.

So in this project having a reliable and integratable external ADC is important.
