# Power Line.

Meaning of Power Line:
1. Definition – A power line is a conductor or system of conductors used to transmit and distribute electrical energy from power plants to end users.


2. Function – It carries electrical power in the form of alternating current (AC) or direct current (DC) over long or short distances.


3. Types –                                  
Transmission lines: Carry high-voltage electricity over long distances.

Distribution lines: Supply electricity at lower voltages to homes, businesses, and industries.



4. Voltage Levels – Can range from a few hundred volts (for local distribution) to hundreds of kilovolts (for high-voltage transmission).



5. Importance in the Project – In this project, the power line is the medium where faults (short circuits, line-to-ground faults, etc.) occur, which need to be detected and isolated in real time using FPGA-based systems.


6. Common Faults – Short circuits, open circuits, line-to-ground faults, and overloading.


7. Safety Aspect – Proper monitoring and protection of power lines are essential to prevent accidents and power outages.
