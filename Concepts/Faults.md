# Faults in the system.

What are Faults ?                           
In a power system, a fault is any abnormal condition such as a short circuit, overload, or line-to-ground connection.     
In this project:

Fault Injection Circuit: Used to simulate faults on the low-voltage test line for safety.

Simulated Fault Types:

Short Circuit (sudden voltage drop, high current spike)

Overload Condition (gradual voltage drop under load)
