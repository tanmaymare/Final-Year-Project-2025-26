# Personal Log

This is my personal log that will document all the things i do for the project, learning of the skills, new concepts, rebrushing and building verilog codes / modules from basic-intermediate-to advance. It is the glimpse of my journey of 2025-26 on this project.

|  | example   | ✅ Done, ⏳ In Progress, ❌ Not Started     | ......... |
| 24-06-2025  | Implementation of  verilog codes for MUX 2:1, 4:1, 8:1 | ✅ Done| Doing well since last 3 days, able to write, debug and simulate basic to mux level verilog codes |
|11- 07 - 2025 | Implementing more verilog codes: Adders and counters and flipflops | ⏳ In Progress |  I have progressed in my personal implementations of verilog codes, Using Vivado now: simulations done of Adders and 4 bit binary counter. Having some issue with the implementation\
