# Test Programs before the main project
I will be doing a simple and short test programs / project to analyze if the hardware is capable for the implementation of the complete project.

## âœ… Mini Feasibility Test Project: "XOR Neural Inference in Verilog"
*Goal: Implement one neuron that solves the XOR problem using fixed-point weights and ReLU activation on Basys 3*.
<br>
### ðŸ”§ Project Summary
**Inputs:** 2-bit (Switches)
**Weights:** Pre-trained, hardcoded (e.g., w1 = 1, w2 = -1, bias = 0)
**MAC Unit:** Multiplies inputs & adds bias
**Activation:** ReLU (y = max(0, sum))
**Output:** 1-bit LED (ON = XOR match, OFF = mismatch)
