# Final-Year-Project-2025-26

The project is in the domain of FPGA / Embedded + Power electronics.
<br>
<br>
Upon deep diving in FPGA, verilog and the recent trends in the FPGA limitless potential for integration in different systems.. Selecting a project which has a practical scope and having a meaningful purpose on scaling is important for a final year project.
